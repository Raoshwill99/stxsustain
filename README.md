# STX for Sustainability: Real-World Environmental Impact Solutions

## Overview

STX for Sustainability is a blockchain-based solution built on the Stacks ecosystem, aiming to create a framework for funding and incentivizing environmental projects using STX. By tokenizing carbon credits, supporting sustainable practices, providing a marketplace for trading, integrating real-world data, and now implementing a governance system, this project promotes ecological responsibility while enhancing the value of STX.

## Features

- Register and manage carbon credits tied to specific real-world projects
- Verification system for carbon credits with project data validation
- Transfer verified carbon credits between users
- Marketplace for listing and trading carbon credits
- Integration with real-world data sources for carbon offset projects
- Governance system for community-driven decision making
- Track total carbon credits in the system
- Manage verifiers for credit validation and data sources for project input

## Smart Contract

The core of this project is a Clarity smart contract that manages carbon credits, facilitates a marketplace, integrates real-world project data, and implements a governance system. Here are the main functions:

### Carbon Credit Management
- `register-carbon-credits`: Allow users to register new carbon credits tied to specific projects
- `verify-carbon-credits`: Enable authorized verifiers to approve pending credits with project verification
- `transfer-carbon-credits`: Enable the transfer of verified carbon credits between users

### Verifier and Data Source Management
- `set-verifier` / `remove-verifier`: Allow the contract owner to manage authorized verifiers
- `set-data-source` / `remove-data-source`: Allow the contract owner to manage authorized data sources

### Project Data Management
- `input-project-data`: Allow authorized data sources to input data about carbon reduction projects

### Marketplace Functions
- `create-listing`: Create a new listing to sell carbon credits
- `cancel-listing`: Cancel an existing listing
- `buy-credits`: Purchase credits from an existing listing

### Governance Functions
- `create-proposal`: Create a new proposal for community voting
- `vote`: Cast a vote on an active proposal
- `finalize-proposal`: Finalize a proposal after its voting period ends

### Read-only Functions
- `get-carbon-credits`: Retrieve the carbon credit balance for a given account
- `get-total-carbon-credits`: Get the total number of verified carbon credits in the system
- `is-verifier`: Check if an account is an authorized verifier
- `is-data-source`: Check if an account is an authorized data source
- `get-listing`: Get details of a specific listing
- `get-all-listings`: Retrieve all active listings in the marketplace
- `get-project-data`: Retrieve data for a specific project
- `get-credit-projects`: Get the projects associated with an account's credits
- `get-proposal`: Get details of a specific proposal
- `get-vote`: Check the vote of a specific user on a specific proposal

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet): A Clarity runtime packaged as a command line tool
- [Stacks Wallet](https://www.hiro.so/wallet): To interact with the Stacks blockchain

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stx-for-sustainability.git
   cd stx-for-sustainability
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   clarinet requirements
   ```

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```
clarinet test
```

### Deployment

To deploy the contract to the Stacks testnet:

1. Configure your Stacks wallet with testnet STX
2. Use Clarinet to deploy:
   ```
   clarinet deploy --testnet
   ```

## Usage

Interact with the contract using the Stacks CLI or integrate it into your Stacks-based application.

Example of creating a proposal:

```
stx call create-proposal title "New Verifier" description "Propose to add a new verifier" link none duration u1440 --fee 1000 --nonce 0
```

Example of voting on a proposal:

```
stx call vote proposal-id u1 vote-bool true --fee 1000 --nonce 1
```

## Governance Process

1. Any user can create a proposal for community consideration.
2. Proposals have a minimum duration to ensure sufficient time for community participation.
3. Users can vote 'yes' or 'no' on active proposals.
4. After the voting period ends, anyone can call to finalize the proposal.
5. Proposals are marked as 'passed' or 'rejected' based on the voting results.

## Project Data Integration Process

1. Authorized data sources input real-world project data, including carbon reduction amounts.
2. Users can register carbon credits only up to the amount of carbon reduction achieved by a project.
3. When verifying credits, the system checks that the credits match the specified project.
4. All carbon credits are now traceable back to specific real-world projects.

## Verification Process

1. Users register carbon credits, which are initially in a 'pending' state and tied to a specific project.
2. Authorized verifiers can approve pending credits, moving them to a 'verified' state, ensuring they match the specified project data.
3. Only verified credits can be transferred between users or listed on the marketplace.

## Marketplace Process

1. Sellers create listings for their verified carbon credits, specifying amount and price.
2. Buyers can view all active listings and choose to purchase credits.
3. When a purchase is made, STX is transferred from the buyer to the seller, and carbon credits are transferred from the seller to the buyer.
4. Listings are automatically removed once the purchase is complete.
