# STX 4 Sustainability: Real-World Environmental Impact Solutions

## Overview

STX for Sustainability is a blockchain-based solution built on the Stacks ecosystem, aiming to create a framework for funding and incentivizing environmental projects using STX. By tokenizing carbon credits and supporting sustainable practices, this project promotes ecological responsibility while enhancing the value of STX.

## Features

- Register and manage carbon credits
- Verification system for carbon credits
- Transfer verified carbon credits between users
- Track total carbon credits in the system
- Manage verifiers for credit validation

## Smart Contract

The core of this project is a Clarity smart contract that manages carbon credits. Here are the main functions:

- `register-carbon-credits`: Allow users to register new carbon credits (pending state)
- `verify-carbon-credits`: Enable authorized verifiers to approve pending credits
- `transfer-carbon-credits`: Enable the transfer of verified carbon credits between users
- `set-verifier`: Allow the contract owner to designate authorized verifiers
- `remove-verifier`: Allow the contract owner to remove verifier status
- `get-carbon-credits`: Retrieve the carbon credit balance for a given account
- `get-total-carbon-credits`: Get the total number of verified carbon credits in the system
- `is-verifier`: Check if an account is an authorized verifier

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet): A Clarity runtime packaged as a command line tool
- [Stacks Wallet](https://www.hiro.so/wallet): To interact with the Stacks blockchain

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stx-for-sustainability.git
   cd stx-for-sustainability
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   clarinet requirements
   ```

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```
clarinet test
```

### Deployment

To deploy the contract to the Stacks testnet:

1. Configure your Stacks wallet with testnet STX
2. Use Clarinet to deploy:
   ```
   clarinet deploy --testnet
   ```

## Usage

Interact with the contract using the Stacks CLI or integrate it into your Stacks-based application.

Example of registering carbon credits:

```
stx call register-carbon-credits amount u100 --fee 1000 --nonce 0
```

Example of verifying carbon credits (for authorized verifiers only):

```
stx call verify-carbon-credits account SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRV9EJ7 amount u50 --fee 1000 --nonce 1
```

## Verification Process

1. Users register carbon credits, which are initially in a 'pending' state.
2. Authorized verifiers can approve pending credits, moving them to a 'verified' state.
3. Only verified credits can be transferred between users.

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement basic carbon credit management
- [x] Add verification system for carbon credits
- [ ] Create a marketplace for trading verified carbon credits
- [ ] Integrate with real-world data sources for carbon offset projects
- [ ] Implement governance mechanisms for project approval and fund allocation
- [ ] Add incentive structures for participants
