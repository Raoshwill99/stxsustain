# STX for Sustainability: Real-World Environmental Impact Solutions

## Overview

STX for Sustainability is a blockchain-based solution built on the Stacks ecosystem, aiming to create a framework for funding and incentivizing environmental projects using STX. By tokenizing carbon credits, supporting sustainable practices, and providing a marketplace for trading, this project promotes ecological responsibility while enhancing the value of STX.

## Features

- Register and manage carbon credits
- Verification system for carbon credits
- Transfer verified carbon credits between users
- Marketplace for listing and trading carbon credits
- Track total carbon credits in the system
- Manage verifiers for credit validation

## Smart Contract

The core of this project is a Clarity smart contract that manages carbon credits and facilitates a marketplace. Here are the main functions:

### Carbon Credit Management
- `register-carbon-credits`: Allow users to register new carbon credits (pending state)
- `verify-carbon-credits`: Enable authorized verifiers to approve pending credits
- `transfer-carbon-credits`: Enable the transfer of verified carbon credits between users

### Verifier Management
- `set-verifier`: Allow the contract owner to designate authorized verifiers
- `remove-verifier`: Allow the contract owner to remove verifier status

### Marketplace Functions
- `create-listing`: Create a new listing to sell carbon credits
- `cancel-listing`: Cancel an existing listing
- `buy-credits`: Purchase credits from an existing listing

### Read-only Functions
- `get-carbon-credits`: Retrieve the carbon credit balance for a given account
- `get-total-carbon-credits`: Get the total number of verified carbon credits in the system
- `is-verifier`: Check if an account is an authorized verifier
- `get-listing`: Get details of a specific listing
- `get-all-listings`: Retrieve all active listings in the marketplace

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet): A Clarity runtime packaged as a command line tool
- [Stacks Wallet](https://www.hiro.so/wallet): To interact with the Stacks blockchain

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stx-for-sustainability.git
   cd stx-for-sustainability
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   clarinet requirements
   ```

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```
clarinet test
```

### Deployment

To deploy the contract to the Stacks testnet:

1. Configure your Stacks wallet with testnet STX
2. Use Clarinet to deploy:
   ```
   clarinet deploy --testnet
   ```

## Usage

Interact with the contract using the Stacks CLI or integrate it into your Stacks-based application.

Example of registering carbon credits:

```
stx call register-carbon-credits amount u100 --fee 1000 --nonce 0
```

Example of creating a listing to sell carbon credits:

```
stx call create-listing amount u50 price u1000000 --fee 1000 --nonce 1
```

Example of buying carbon credits from a listing:

```
stx call buy-credits listing-id u1 --fee 1000 --nonce 2
```

## Marketplace Process

1. Sellers create listings for their verified carbon credits, specifying amount and price.
2. Buyers can view all active listings and choose to purchase credits.
3. When a purchase is made, STX is transferred from the buyer to the seller, and carbon credits are transferred from the seller to the buyer.
4. Listings are automatically removed once the purchase is complete.

## Verification Process

1. Users register carbon credits, which are initially in a 'pending' state.
2. Authorized verifiers can approve pending credits, moving them to a 'verified' state.
3. Only verified credits can be transferred between users or listed on the marketplace.

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement basic carbon credit management
- [x] Add verification system for carbon credits
- [x] Create a marketplace for trading verified carbon credits
- [ ] Integrate with real-world data sources for carbon offset projects
- [ ] Implement governance mechanisms for project approval and fund allocation
- [ ] Add incentive structures for participants
