# STX for Sustainability: Real-World Environmental Impact Solutions

## Overview

STX for Sustainability is a blockchain-based solution built on the Stacks ecosystem, aiming to create a framework for funding and incentivizing environmental projects using STX. By tokenizing carbon credits and supporting sustainable practices, this project promotes ecological responsibility while enhancing the value of STX.

## Features

- Register and manage carbon credits
- Transfer carbon credits between users
- Track total carbon credits in the system

## Smart Contract

The core of this project is a Clarity smart contract that manages carbon credits. Here are the main functions:

- `register-carbon-credits`: Allow users to register new carbon credits
- `transfer-carbon-credits`: Enable the transfer of carbon credits between users
- `get-carbon-credits`: Retrieve the carbon credit balance for a given account
- `get-total-carbon-credits`: Get the total number of carbon credits in the system

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet): A Clarity runtime packaged as a command line tool
- [Stacks Wallet](https://www.hiro.so/wallet): To interact with the Stacks blockchain

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stx-for-sustainability.git
   cd stx-for-sustainability
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   clarinet requirements
   ```

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```
clarinet test
```

### Deployment

To deploy the contract to the Stacks testnet:

1. Configure your Stacks wallet with testnet STX
2. Use Clarinet to deploy:
   ```
   clarinet deploy --testnet
   ```

## Usage

Interact with the contract using the Stacks CLI or integrate it into your Stacks-based application.

Example of registering carbon credits:

```
stx call register-carbon-credits amount u100 --fee 1000 --nonce 0
```

## Roadmap

- Implement a verification system for carbon credits
- Create a marketplace for trading carbon credits
- Integrate with real-world data sources for carbon offset projects
- Implement governance mechanisms for project approval and fund allocation
- Add incentive structures for participants
